POC Projects Folder Structure

This repository holds separate Proof of Concept (POC) implementations for different computer vision use cases (Dynamic Privacy Masking, Queue Management, Heatmap, Intrusion Detection, etc.).

Each use case folder follows a common structure to keep training data, test data, source code, and outputs organized.

poc_projects/

├── <use_case_name>/
│   ├── data/
│   │   ├── train/    → Training dataset for the use case
│   │   ├── test/     → Test dataset for evaluation
│   │   └── val/      → Validation dataset (optional, used during training)

│   ├── src/          → Source code specific to the use case

Notes

Each use case (e.g., dynamic_privacy_masking/, queue_management/, etc.) is independent and self-contained.

data/ should be lightweight for POCs; store large raw datasets externally and reference them via symlinks or .gitignore.

src/ may include both Python and C++ code depending on Rockchip deployment requirements.

models/ should hold both converted ONNX files and optimized models.

output/ should be cleared or compressed periodically to save space.

logs/ can be used for TensorBoard logs, error reports, and debugging.
